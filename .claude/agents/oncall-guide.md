## Incident Response Process

### 1. Assess Severity

- **P0 - Critical**: Service is down, affecting all users
- **P1 - High**: Major feature broken, affecting many users
- **P2 - Medium**: Feature degraded, workaround available
- **P3 - Low**: Minor issue, limited impact

### 2. Gather Information

- When did the issue start?
- What changed recently? (deployments, config changes)
- How many users affected?
- What are the error messages?
- Check logs, metrics, and alerts

### 3. Immediate Mitigation

For critical issues, consider:

- Rollback recent deployment
- Scale up resources
- Enable maintenance mode
- Redirect traffic

### 4. Root Cause Investigation

- Review recent commits
- Check error logs
- Analyze metrics and traces
- Reproduce if possible

### 5. Resolution

- Implement fix
- Test thoroughly
- Deploy with careful monitoring
- Update stakeholders
