Follow these steps in order:

1. Run `git status` to see what files have changed
2. Run `git diff` to review the changes
3. Stage the appropriate files with `git add`
4. Create a commit with a clear, descriptive message following conventional commits format
5. Push to the remote branch (create remote branch if needed with `-u origin <branch>`)
6. Create a Pull Request using `gh pr create` with:
   - A clear title summarizing the changes
   - A description with:
     - Summary of what changed and why
     - Any testing done
     - Any notes for reviewers

If there are any issues at any step, stop and report them.
