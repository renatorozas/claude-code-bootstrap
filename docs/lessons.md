# Lessons Learned

> Rules derived from past mistakes. Review at session start. Keep entries concise.
> Format: what went wrong → rule to follow.

<!-- Example:
- **Forgot to run tests before committing** → Always run `npm test` before any commit.
- **Changed API response format without updating frontend** → When modifying API responses, grep for all consumers and update them in the same PR.
